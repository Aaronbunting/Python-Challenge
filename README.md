## Background
What Youâ€™re Creating:

In this assignment, you will create a Python script that analyzes the financial records of your company.  Inside your starter code, you will find a financial dataset in the budget_data.csv file. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

## Instructions
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period

3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


## Results
Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  * Financial Analysis
  ------------------
  * Total Months: 86
  
  * Total: $38382578
  
  * Average  Change: $-2315.12
  
  * Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  
  * Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
